## <mark>Educational Purpose</mark>

**Project: Development of a Machine Learning Model to Predict Values From Data Using Regression Algorithms**

This project focuses on developing predictive machine learning models using various Regression algorithms.
- Simple Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression

All for educational purposes to improve learning how ML models work.

This models development is <strong><ins>IN PROGRESS</ins></strong> and serves as an integral component of my learning process, specifically targeting skills needed for machine learning deployment and optimization.
