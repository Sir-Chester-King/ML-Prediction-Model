"""
One-hot encoding (or "hot coding") is a technique used to convert categorical variables into a
format that can be fed to machine learning models.
Since machine learning models generally work best with numeric dataset, one-hot encoding transforms
categorical variables into numeric columns.

Sklearn ColumnTransformer's class is a useful tool for applying different transformations
to different columns in a dataset.
It is especially useful when you are dealing with datasets that contain both numeric
and categorical variables, and you want to apply different preprocessing techniques to
each of them.


Sklearn LabelEncoder's class is used to transform categorical variables into numeric values.
It is a useful tool when working with machine learning models that require numeric input, such as
many classification and Regressions models.
